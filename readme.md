# What is this?

As I was building http://balance-dresden.info and http://wachtraumarbeit.info
I reused the code in both applications by always copying the files between the two projects

To simplify this I want to make the extensions, modules, components, controller etc. all external

aiajaya is the project which contains the most important modules

aiajaya stands for aiajaya is also just another yii application.
As I'm not thinking anyone will try it, there is no documentation here.. But when you think, this application
will help you, I'm happy to help you.
